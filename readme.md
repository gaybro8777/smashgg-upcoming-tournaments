# Smash.gg Upcoming Tournaments Scraper
From an unreleased side project; might be fun and/or interesting for some people. As with any scraper, you're on your own - service endpoints can change at any time, and this code is not guaranteed to work nor does this in any way give you permission from Smash.gg to scrape their endpoints. While it's all public data that's being scraped from an API endpoint, I'm not them and can't give you that permission and they explicitly note their API is bound to break at their discretion. Probably should ask them first.
